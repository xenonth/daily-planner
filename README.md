### Technologies Used:
For the layout of this project bootstrap was used in combination with Jquery and moment.js.  Moment.js was utilised to check the current time of the user's destination and based on their time the color of the table would change to inform the user if the planned slot has past, present or future. The past displays the color of grey, red for the present and red for the future.  In future updates there are plans to make this application more complete.  

### Approach
I tried to be clever and use a while or for loop to append and create the table which was not working so I opted for manual creation which is also reflected in the conditionals to test the time for what the current block is.  
By comparing the flat hour time against the current time causing the color change in the table sections.
