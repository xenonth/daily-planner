The above application is designed to be used as a daily work planner by using the text box and to use the save data so if the page is refreshed the work planner can be reused.

### Approach
I tried to be clever and use a while or for loop to append and create the table which was not working so I opted for manual creation which is also reflected in the conditionals to test the time for what the current block is.  
By comparing the flat hour time against the current time causing the color change in the table sections.
